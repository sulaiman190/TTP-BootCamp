	<h3>MY BIOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>
		My biography 
        I am Sulaiman Jalloh from West Africa, Sierra Leone. I live with my family in the Bronx; I have two sisters and one brother.  I’m a student at LaGuardia Community College. My major is Computer Science. I was born in an English speaking country Sierra Leone in West Africa but I grew up in a French speaking country Guinea Conakry also located in West Africa. 
      	One of the reasons my family moved to Guinea Conakry was because of the rebellion. The rebels were group of people that were taking act of violent on or open resistance to an established government or rules. They were killing people everywhere in the country even killing children. When it started getting worse than we thought, my dad decided to move to the closest country called Guinea Conakry where I grew up and learned to speak French, Fulani, and Soso.
     	 My mother, my two little sisters, my little brother and I were living in Guinea for five years while my dad was in the United States looking for better opportunities. So at those moments my dad didn’t have documents in the United States to help us come here. After he got his documents, he dad decided to bring us here to study and live better. Finally today we here in the United States living in a better condition and going to school. When I came here my life totally changed because I have the opportunity to work while going to school, help my dad to pay his bills. I made I lots of friends that from different countries  Guinea Conakry was not bad for me while I was living there because I learned different cultures and I also learned many different languages and I made lots of friends while we was living there.
      	I chose Computer Science as my Major because I feel computers are the future and I enjoy working with computers and creating basic programs. I believe this major will give me the opportunities to do
