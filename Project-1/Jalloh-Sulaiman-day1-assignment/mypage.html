	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<!-- starting paragraph about me -->
	<p>
		I am Sulaiman Jalloh. I am 27 years old and I live in the Bronx. I am originally from West Africa, Sierra Leone. 
		<br>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Lehman college. <br>I am also graduated with an Associate Degree in Computer Science at LaGuardia Community college. <br>I have experience in java and c++ and little in networking system. I am currently looking for internship where I can learn more, improve myself and get more experience. <br>I am self-motivated person who like to work hard and get the job done. However, I like to take my time to do the job right because I believe with patience, motivation everything is possible. <br>I donâ€™t believe in quitting because I always push myself very hard. <br>I believe trying is another way to describe my failure, I always make sure I accomplish what I started and get the job done. <br>I am currently working an overnight shift as a building concierge to pay for my school and put food on the table for my family but I make sure I show up to class on time and do the work. <br>I like to learn new things but I enjoy programing because I found myself very happy I finish working code and running perfectly.
